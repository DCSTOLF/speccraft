# speccraft

A Claude Code plugin that enforces spec-first TDD via hooks, slash commands, subagents, and cross-model review.

## Stack

- Bash 5+ hooks (`hooks/`) wired through `hooks/hooks.json`
- Go helper binaries under `tools/cmd/speccraft-{state,guard,drift}` sharing `tools/internal/{speccraft,delegate}` (module `github.com/dcstolf/speccraft/tools`; `go.mod` declares Go 1.22, CI runs Go 1.26.3)
- Markdown slash commands (`commands/`) and subagents (`agents/`)
- Markdown skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)
- Stack-agnostic memory templates (`templates/speccraft/`) copied into a host repo by `/speccraft:init`
- Devcontainer-based end-to-end test (`tests/e2e/run.sh`) driven by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Architecture in one paragraph

speccraft is packaged as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, marketplace `dcstolf-tools`) and ships three execution surfaces: shell hooks that gate Edit/Write tool calls, slash commands the user invokes (`/speccraft:init`, `/speccraft:spec:*`, `/speccraft:sync`), and subagents the orchestrator dispatches (planner, critic, reviewer, delegator, memory-keeper). Hooks and commands call small Go binaries — `speccraft-state` (session/spec state in `.speccraft/state.json`), `speccraft-guard` (TDD red→green invariant), and `speccraft-drift` (regex scan of `enforce:` rules in memory files) — whose shared logic lives in `tools/internal/speccraft`. The repo dogfoods its own plugin: `.speccraft/` here is real project memory for this very codebase, not a fixture.

## Hard rules (see guardrails.md)

- Never commit built binaries from `bin/` or `tools/bin/`.
- Never bypass the TDD red→green invariant without `/speccraft:spec:override` with a recorded reason.
- Plugin templates under `templates/speccraft/` must stay stack-agnostic (no Go-, Python-, or HTTP-specific assumptions).

## Where to look

- Hooks: `hooks/` (entry: `hooks/hooks.json`)
- Slash commands: `commands/` (top-level + `commands/spec/`)
- Subagents: `agents/`
- Skills: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Go helper binaries: `tools/cmd/speccraft-*/main.go`
- Shared Go logic: `tools/internal/speccraft/`, `tools/internal/delegate/`
- User-facing memory templates: `templates/speccraft/`
- E2E test harness: `tests/e2e/run.sh`
- Specs: `specs/NNNN-<slug>/`

## Recent decisions (last 3)

- 2026-06-22 — Milestone version bump to 1.5.0 (spec 0023): coordinated 1.1.0 → 1.5.0 bump across all five live version surfaces — the two manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and the three binary `const version` declarations (`speccraft-{state,guard,drift}`) — same hardcoded mechanism as spec 0019, only the value moves. Each const bump pinned RED→GREEN by its sibling version test (asserts the NEW value, fails pre-edit); manifests verified by a grep oracle (positive `1.5.0` + no stray `1.1.0`). Marks the spec-0022 milestone; pushing the bumped `plugin.json` to `main` triggers the `auto-tag` CI job (spec 0021) → `v1.5.0` → `release.yml`. Done as its own in-progress spec because production edits require an active spec (the guard's active-spec gate fires before override consumption — `override_pending` cannot bypass "no active spec"). No deviations.
- 2026-06-22 — Optional PM and Architect workflows ship upstream of specs (spec 0022): add advisory `/speccraft:pm:{new,review,prioritize,close}` and `/speccraft:arch:{new,review,decide,close}` namespaces above the spec lifecycle (PM → Architect → Spec → implement) — specs stay fully standalone (AC1), upstream lanes are additive, never flag-gated. PM artifacts under `product/NNNN-slug/` (`brief.md`), Architect under `design/NNNN-slug/` (`design.md`); both reuse existing machinery (`cross-reviewer` backs both `*:review` unchanged; `arch:close` routes durable decisions through the existing `memory-keeper` — no new store). Three AC1/AC7-driven choices: (1) state shape is ADDITIVE SIBLING keys `active_product`/`active_design` (`,omitempty`), `active_spec` byte-identical — a nested/`kind`-discriminated record was REJECTED (it would defeat the `run.sh` close-gate `jq -r '.active_spec // "null"'`, the raw-jq revise preflight, and the four e2e fixture literals); lane independence asserted at the serialization layer + single-writer lock extended. (2) AC3 doc-zone is a markdown-scoped REGRESSION PIN (`product/`/`design/` `*.md` allowed via the pre-existing `ext==".md"` rule; NEGATIVE rows prove a SOURCE file under those trees stays gated), NOT a `prefix()` entry — adding one would reopen the broad bypass. (3) Cross-stage linkage is PULL-ONLY/advisory: `spec:new --from product/<id>|design/<id>` pulls Why/What and writes a non-empty `informed-by` key, plain `spec:new` writes NO key (byte-shape parity); a missing/deleted/closed referent is NON-FATAL (AC8). Closed-artifact immutability stays by-convention (no status-aware guard, out of scope). Four agents added (pm/arch author+critic). New convention: credit-gated e2e fixtures are SOURCED into run.sh (share `run_claude`), not subshelled. Tests: go test green, bats 77/77, verify.sh oracle green; two credit-gated e2e fixtures `bash -n` clean but full lifecycle pending user e2e. ONE override (T3): guard's `applyEdit` models `Edit.new_string` but not `Write.content`, so a Write-created sibling test can't be observed as runtime RED → follow-up spec. Landed in commit `daaa251` (ff to `main`).
- 2026-06-18 — Release pipeline self-verifies and auto-tags on version bump; the source-build fallback is no longer silent (spec 0021): fixed the root cause of "plugin compiles from source at runtime instead of downloading release assets" — no `vX.Y.Z` tag had ever been pushed, so the tag-triggered `release.yml` never ran, every asset URL 404'd, and `install-binaries.sh`'s `curl … 2>/dev/null && …` chain masked it by falling through to `go build`. New `auto-tag` CI job (`push` to `main`) runs pure `scripts/auto-tag.sh should_tag` and pushes `vX.Y.Z` via `secrets.RELEASE_TAG_PAT` — NOT `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose built-in loop guard suppresses `on: push: tags` re-triggers (claude-p's highest-priority latent-correctness catch, CF-1). New `scripts/verify-release.sh` is a strong-form oracle (downloads each of the 4 tarballs + `checksums.txt`, recomputes SHA-256, fails loud+named) reused as `release.yml`'s final self-verify step keyed to `github.ref_name` — deadlock-free (guard keys off the tag, never bare `plugin.json`). `install-binaries.sh` replaces the silent chain with `if ! curl …; then warn(URL); fi` (set -e safe) + a gitignored `.binary-provenance` marker (`download`|`source`); `doctor.sh` reports the distinct "built from source (download unavailable)" state. Asset-name contract fixed: publish `checksums.txt` (was `checksums-merged.txt`), regenerated `sha256sum *.tar.gz` to fix a per-arch collision (beyond named scope). All 4 scripts hermetic via `SPECCRAFT_RELEASE_BASE` `file://` fixtures, pinned by sibling shell tests in `run_helper_unit_tests()`. Deviation: NO `/speccraft:spec:override` needed — `speccraft-guard` does not gate `.sh` files (plan wrongly assumed it would). Orthogonal CI tweak: `paths-ignore` denylist extended for doc-only `LICENSE`/`speccraft-technical-review.md`/`speccraft-v1-spec.md` (denylist, never allowlist; `plugin.json` must keep triggering CI). Two-round review, quorum met rev 2 with 4 carry-forwards folded in (CF-1 PAT, CF-2 cheap-hermetic tier, CF-3 AC5 wording, CF-4 strong-form checksums). Ops: `RELEASE_TAG_PAT` secret DONE; the landing push auto-tags `v1.1.0` (the first real release) — verify in CI run history.
