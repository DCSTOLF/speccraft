# speccraft

A Claude Code plugin that enforces spec-first TDD via hooks, slash commands, subagents, and cross-model review.

## Stack

- Bash 5+ hooks (`hooks/`) wired through `hooks/hooks.json`
- Go helper binaries under `tools/cmd/speccraft-{state,guard,drift}` sharing `tools/internal/{speccraft,delegate}` (module `github.com/dcstolf/speccraft/tools`; `go.mod` declares Go 1.22, CI runs Go 1.26.3)
- Markdown slash commands (`commands/`) and subagents (`agents/`)
- Markdown skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)
- Stack-agnostic memory templates (`templates/speccraft/`) copied into a host repo by `/speccraft:init`
- Devcontainer-based end-to-end test (`tests/e2e/run.sh`) driven by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Architecture in one paragraph

speccraft is packaged as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, marketplace `dcstolf-tools`) and ships three execution surfaces: shell hooks that gate Edit/Write tool calls, slash commands the user invokes (`/speccraft:init`, `/speccraft:spec:*`, `/speccraft:sync`), and subagents the orchestrator dispatches (planner, critic, reviewer, delegator, memory-keeper). Hooks and commands call small Go binaries — `speccraft-state` (session/spec state in `.speccraft/state.json`), `speccraft-guard` (TDD red→green invariant), and `speccraft-drift` (regex scan of `enforce:` rules in memory files) — whose shared logic lives in `tools/internal/speccraft`. The repo dogfoods its own plugin: `.speccraft/` here is real project memory for this very codebase, not a fixture.

## Hard rules (see guardrails.md)

- Never commit built binaries from `bin/` or `tools/bin/`.
- Never bypass the TDD red→green invariant without `/speccraft:spec:override` with a recorded reason.
- Plugin templates under `templates/speccraft/` must stay stack-agnostic (no Go-, Python-, or HTTP-specific assumptions).

## Where to look

- Hooks: `hooks/` (entry: `hooks/hooks.json`)
- Slash commands: `commands/` (top-level + `commands/spec/`)
- Subagents: `agents/`
- Skills: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Go helper binaries: `tools/cmd/speccraft-*/main.go`
- Shared Go logic: `tools/internal/speccraft/`, `tools/internal/delegate/`
- User-facing memory templates: `templates/speccraft/`
- E2E test harness: `tests/e2e/run.sh`
- Specs: `specs/NNNN-<slug>/`

## Recent decisions (last 3)

- 2026-06-08 — fix override no-op (spec 0009): `ConsumeOverride` API wired into `goPythonProdGuard`; single-shot atomic read-and-clear under `mu.Lock()`; single-writer allow-list extended to all `Session` fields; consume-on-use pattern codified in conventions
- 2026-05-29 — CI hardening (spec 0008): two-job split (cheap language-only vs expensive lifecycle), `ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE:` annotation model, close-commit invariant convention; pre-close gate satisfied by run 26658905606 which also retroactively satisfied spec 0007 T10
- 2026-05-29 — Python e2e fixture (spec 0007): symmetric-coverage gap closed; e2e-language-fixture pattern codified in conventions; T10 CI-verification deferred to spec 0008
